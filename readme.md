# pyROVmotion: Python modules suite for steady-state and time-domain analysis for Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV)
This repository contains Python modules for configuring and running steady-state and time-domain computations of ROV motion.
The user may use the modules for analyzing ROV motion feasibility or just computing time-domain motion scenarios.
The modules bring the user classes to configure and run the computation scenarios.

The suite is composed by the following modules:
1. rov.py
2. ... more coming up
